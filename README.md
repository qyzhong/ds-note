# Beat the Shit Out of Data Science Interviews 

Work-in-progress notes (with a crazy name and random updates) on data science, machine learning, causal inference and more. 

Not just for interviews, more for learning.

# Machine learning:

Many of the notes were written based on my reading of:  
* Koller D, Friedman N, Džeroski S, Sutton C, McCallum A, Pfeffer A, Abbeel P, Wong MF, Heckerman D, Meek C, Neville J. Introduction to statistical relational learning. MIT press; 2007. 
* Friedman J, Hastie T, Tibshirani R. The elements of statistical learning. New York: Springer series in statistics; 2001. 
* Andrew Ng's deep learning course on Coursera
